    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or in the other media.</li><br>
        <li><s>CSS is not neccesary</s><span style="background-color: yellow;">CSS saves a lot of work</span>. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li><ins>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</ins></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <ul class="test">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li">The most common way to add CSS , to keep the styles in external CSS files. 
        However, <span class="test1">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yoyurself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="test3">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. </p>
    
    <p class="test4">In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of stlyes can be applied to the element. </p>
    
    <p class="test5">There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
